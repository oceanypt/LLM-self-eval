The results suggest that my original assumption was incorrect. The actual cause of the problem was the use of an outdated version of the library. upgrading the library to the latest version should fix the problem.
Adhesive intestinal obstruction occurs when part of the intestine becomes stuck to another part of the intestine or to another structure in the abdominal cavity. This can happen because a portion of the bowel was not developed properly in the fetus, or the bowel became attached to the liver, small intestine, or other abdominal structures at birth.

Intravenous Zanamivir is used to treat laboratory confirmed influenza infection. It works by blocking the action of influenza viruses that need a protein called NA to infect cells and to get from one host cell to another. Since the protein NA is located on the surface of influenza viruses, they are also called aerolysin-like proteins. Zanamivir gets into the body by the respiratory tract and blocks the virus from spreading into the cells of the respiratory tract and from one cell to another.\n\nOne study has shown that intranasal administration of Zanamivir is effective in treating influenza infection in mice. However, there are no human studies. Therefore, Zanamivir should not be used to treat human influenza infection.
I had a recurring dream that I was being chased by a monster. Even though I was being chased, I was unable to reach for my cellphone to call for help. I would always wake up right before I was actually eaten by the monster.

Delaunay triangulation can be converted to a graph representation where each vertex of the graph is a triangle's vertex and each edge of the graph represents two triangles sharing an edge in the Delaunay triangulation.
No
Yes, that is normal. Spitting is the first sign that a woman is pregnant. As the fetus develops in the uterus, the fetus makes red blood cells which makes the blood appear pink. When the fetal heart starts functioning it makes a substance called hCG which changes the blood's color to reddish.
Pitt Bulls are instinctively protective creatures, and will lick and bite at anything that threatens the safety of the pack (or family). In this case, it sounds like your Pitt Bull is reacting to your touch on her back by reflexively scratching at your touch on her own neck and face. Try scrunching up a paper bag, and then rubbing it around your dog’s neck and face. You’ll likely be able to tell where she’s marking because the bag will be pretty rough and scruffy in those spots. This is because your Pitt Bull is similarly marking her own skin to show you that something is amiss. Try putting a hat on your dog, and seeing if she’ll bite at the hat as well. If so, then your dog is likely reacting to a perceived threat on her face (the hat) by scratching at other areas of her body (her neck). Additionally, if your dog is scratching at her eyes, then she may have a more serious medical issue, and you should contact a veterinarian immediately.
Pasado refers to something that happened in the past.
The applications of science positively impact our quality of life by\nproviding medicine and healthcare, transportation, and communication. In\nthe field of medicine, new discoveries lead to the development of new\ntreatments and therapies. For example, medical imaging uses radiation to\ncreate images of body structures for medical diagnosis and treatment.\nTransportation includes the use of science in aeronautics, which leads to\nairplanes, and in space travel, which leads to orbiting spacecraft.\nCommunication technology also uses basic science in the development of\nnew devices and systems. For example, wireless communication technology\nrelies on the properties of electromagnetic waves to transmit data over\ndistances.

You can replace Sunglass Lenses by yourself, but it requires some basic knowledge about eye anatomy and physiology. You should never try this if you have any eye diseases. First, make sure you turn off the glasses power. Then, find a dark room and turn on a bright light. Put the glasses onto a white surface in order to get rid of any reflections. Hold the glasses near your eye with the lens facing your eye. You can now see the inside of your eye with your own eyes. Find the following 3 spots on your eye: The pupil, the iris and the lens. Use a sharp needle or a thin syringe needle to prick the spot you are looking at. You can now see a bright point on the spot. This is the lens. Give it to your eye. You are now able to see in the dark again.
Have you ever experienced an out-of-body experience (OBE)? If yes, then you may be able to explain what happens during an OBE. During an OBE, the consciousness of the person is perceived to be outside the physical body. For example, the person may look down at their own body from a distance. An OBE is a form of lucid dreaming and has been experienced by millions of people across the world. Lucid dreaming is when the dreamer is aware that they are dreaming during the course of the dream. Is it possible to have out-of-body experiences in real life? Scientists continue to research this phenomenon and it is not fully understood.

Yes, a few examples exist. For example, minstrel shows, which involved\nperforming pop music for a theater audience with professional singers and\ninstruments, were popular across social classes. Another example includes\nreligious music, like plainsong, which was very common in both secular and\nreligious settings.
The strategy you described using higher order polynomials to guess ranges in which there could be larger prime numbers might work successfully, however there is a limit to how much more accurate the fit can be.\n\nFor a polynomial of degree n, the error in the fit will be at most C(n) * stdev(data), where C(n) is a constant for a given degree n, and stdev(data) is the standard deviation of the data.\n\nIn the case of the prime number fitting you described, the standard deviation of the data is very small near the beginning of the data set, however as you get further away from the beginning the standard deviation of the data begins to increase very rapidly.\n\nTherefore, the accuracy of the fit will be limited to the beginning of the data set.
Sephardic
This is a very complex question and I cannot answer it in the scope of a\nsingle post.  However, I will say this: All Christians are not the same.\nSimilarly, all Muslims are not the same.  The Christian church has\noverwhelmingly condemned the religion of Islam.  Even the Christian churches that have been the most accepting of Muslims have done so with the caveat\nthat Muslims are peaceful people.  By contrast, Islam has a\ndistinctly different view of who Jesus is.  Jesus is the Isa (Jesus) of\nthe Bible, but Muslims believe he was simply a great prophet like\nMohammed was.  Jesus' death on the cross is equated with the breaking\nof a holy fast.  Muslims go through a holy month of Ramadan and fast\nfrom sunrise to sunset every day.  They prepare food and drink at\nhome, but during the day they give it all to the poor.  They then\ncelebrate the birth of Jesus at Christmas with cookies, milk and\nchocolate.  Finally, during the holy month of Ramadan, they slaughter\nan animal in front of their homes and offer the meat to their God.\nThere is no teaching in the Bible that condemns this behavior.\nAs such, I honestly do not know if a Muslim man is as good as a\nChristian man in the eyes of God.

Rats were treated with topical cilostazol (0.5mg/mL) or vehicle control applied to the anastomosis site of interposition vein grafts. Veins were harvested at 28 days and evaluated for percent area stenosis, vein graft Segment Area (VGSA), and for cell proliferation (Ki67+ cells), inflammation (Mac3+ cells), and extracellular matrix deposition (VGLA+ cells). Topical cilostazol treatment resulted in a trend toward lower percent area stenosis and did not significantly affect VGSA, cell proliferation, inflammation, or extracellular matrix deposition.
Surface Mounted Hinges are often used in commercial or public spaces. These hinges have a flat plate that is painted or coated to match the color of the surface they are attached to. They are also available in many different finishes, such as veneer, painted, chrome, and brushed nickel.
There is no time restriction on when you can drink alcohol after being tested positive for Hep A. It is important to note that alcohol can cause your body to absorb more of this liver enzyme, leading to a higher test result.
No, Plan B should be effective in stopping pregnancy within 72 hours after intercourse. Vaginal bleeding typically occurs 3-7 days after sexual intercourse, which is before the 72 hours is up since intercourse happened.
Remove all of the dead branches from rose bushes. Dead branches will die back in the winter. In the spring, new growth will come from the base of the dead branches. Prune back all of the dead growth except for 1-2 inches from the base of the rose bush. This will ensure new growth and blooms this spring and summer.

If your aquarium is leaking water, turn off the water to the aquarium and locate the leak. In some cases, the leak may be coming from the rubber o-ring around the air valve in the hood. If this is the case, you may be able to replace the o-ring and get the aquarium water seal back. If the leak is coming from the actual air valve, you will need to replace the valve.
Everyone in the world of healthcare uses technology in one way or another. In the past, healthcare technology was used solely by doctors and hospitals. Over time, technology progressed and patients began using it to monitor and manage their own health. Today, patients have access to more information and medical technology than ever before.

There are pros and cons of using threads vs processes for executing a program. Using threads, you can run more than one task at a time, however, it will eat up more memory as each thread requires its own stack. Using processes, you will have to use more memory as only the process context is memory resident, however, you will not be able to run more than one task at a time.
Ok I would explain orbitals in the following way. Electrons are smaller\nparticles than neutrons. They are much smaller than the atoms that they\nare in. Like the electrons in a metal, the electrons in an atom are\ndistributed across different energy levels, or orbitals.\n\nThe different orbitals that electrons can occupy are s, p, d, and f.\nThis means that electrons can occupy 1s energy level, 2s energy level,\n2p energy level, and 3d energy level. The total number of orbitals\navailable to electrons is 6.\n\nThe different energy levels are related to the orbitals in the following\nway. The first energy level that electrons can occupy is called the\n1s energy level. All the other energy levels are higher in energy\nthan the 1s energy level. This means that if an electron starts in the\n1s energy level it has a higher probability of moving to a higher\nenergy level than if it started in any of the other 5 energy levels.
The likelihood of a child having inherited a leaking heart valve from their mother depends on the age of the mother at the time of the child's birth, the age of the child at the time the mother had the valve replaced, and the type of valve replaced. The risk of transmission increases with the age of the mother and decreases with the age of the child at the time the mother had the valve replaced or at the time of the child's birth. The risk of transmission is very low for children who are born with replacement valves, especially when the replacement valves are modern mechanical valves rather than biological valves.

Since you have been sexually active and had a negative home pregnancy test, it is likely that you were recently pregnant and had your period naturally ended. You will need to wait at least 40 weeks (5 months) before you can be absolutely certain that you are not pregnant. DO NOT try to restart your period using any home remedies or methods without first consulting a physician.

In general, yes. If all randomness in a public key encryption scheme was\nexplicitly part of the ciphertext, an adversary could simply try all possible\nrandom values and see which ones result in the same ciphertext. This is called\na chosen-ciphertext attack and is a classic way to break encryption schemes.
Yes. The Bible indicates that the Rapture (the removal of the living from the Earth prior to the seven years of Tribulation) will take place prior to the seven year period of Tribulation, the return of Christ, and the final Judgment.\n\nSome Christians believe that the Tribulation will occur immediately following the second coming of Christ. However, the Bible indicates that a period of time (the Tribulation) will occur prior to the second coming.

Sponges do not have bones or muscles. They do, however, have cells called choanocytes that look like little mobileosomes, which are similar in structure to mitochondria. These cells look like tiny mitochondria, but they are not true mitochondria. They generate energy for the sponge by oxidizing red blood cells that get caught in the sponge's web structure.
Plasma and lcd displays are based on an array of pixels, each of which can be programmed to display various colors.  Plasma and lcd use various technologies to generate different colors.  Plasma uses a combination of gas plasmas to generate colors, and lcd uses a backlight and various types of filters to generate colors.  The backlight is typically generated by a combination of a fluorescent lamp and various types of optics to focus and project the light into the display.  The display projects a combination of filters over the backlight to generate various colors.  The problem with these displays is that the pixels are square and the pixels are projected on a round surface, so the edges of the pixels are visible and the pixels appear blocky.  The visible edges created by this can be reduced by using various pixel smoothing algorithms, but the smoothing algorithm can also reduce image contrast and quality and make the image look worse compared to how it would have looked without the smoothing algorithm.
Hi. There are two kinds of read clipping, physical and logical.\n\nPhysical clipping means that part of a read was actually recorded, but due to\nhardware limits (e.g., max RNA sequencing read length) the rest of the read\nwas not recorded and is now missing.\n\nLogical clipping means the read was not used for aligning due to some\nconstraints in the alignment algorithm. The most common example of\nlogical clipping is when a read contains aN N, where N is a\nnucleotide, and the alignment algorithm relies on exact matches only (so\nany match of N is not reported).
Dogs were originally bred to protect livestock.  They would burrow under the fences and protect the livestock from predators.  They would also bite and chew on the fences to make sure they are not easily breached.  Since they were originally bred to do these tasks, they still exhibit these behaviors today.  This is why your dog may burrow under the bed and chew on your furniture.

It is an immunosuppressant, so it is not considered chemo. Some patients considering it for MPN may also consider it for rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, or nephrotic syndrome. It is not approved for any of these indications, but it has been used off label for them. It can rarely cause leukemia, so patients must be monitored for leukemia at the same time as for their MPN symptoms.

Javascript is interpreted run-time, while c++ is compiled at build time. This means that each time a webpage needs a javascript function to be run, it needs to interpret the javascript code. This is slower than compiling, and calls for a interpreted language typically means it is slower than a compiled language.

This can be done with the help of user-defined variables. The code to be inserted into the MySQL statement will be:\nSET @rownum := 0;\nSELECT col1, col2, col3,\n       @rownum := @rownum + 1 AS rank\nFROM your_table\nORDER BY col1, col2, col3;\n\nEach time a new value is inserted, the variable @rownum will be increased by 1. The SELECT statement uses the @rownum variable to generate a new number to be used as the row number. The ordered results will then be sorted by that number.
The Great Depression hit hard for African American families.  Most families were stuck in long hours of labor with little to no pay.  Corretta Scott King led a hardworking middle-class African American family.  Her husband, Martin Luther King Jr., pulled himself out of the depression with the help of a union job and a college degree.  Their three children also faced hardships during the depression, but thanks to the family's strong work ethic, they were able to grow up with a sense of self worth and the belief that they could achieve anything they put their minds to.
